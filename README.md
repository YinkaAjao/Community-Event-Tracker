2. Problem Background
Problem Statement

What is the Problem?
Students at ALU and similar institutions often miss out on academic, cultural, and social events due to the lack of a centralized platform for event information. Currently, event details are scattered across multiple channels, including social media, emails, and physical flyers, making it difficult for students to stay informed. This fragmentation leads to low event attendance, reduced student engagement, and missed opportunities for community building.

Why is it a Problem?
The absence of a unified event-tracking system creates several challenges:

For Students: They struggle to find events that align with their interests, leading to missed opportunities for personal and academic growth.

For Student Organizations: They face difficulties in promoting events effectively, resulting in lower turnout and reduced impact.

For the Institution: The lack of engagement undermines efforts to foster a vibrant campus community and enhance the student experience.

According to a survey by the National Association for Campus Activities (NACA), 40% of students miss events due to poor communication (NACA, 2022). Additionally, research by EDUCAUSE (2021) highlights that 70% of students prefer mobile apps for accessing campus-related information, indicating a clear demand for digital solutions.

Who is Affected?
Students: They are the primary users who miss out on valuable opportunities for networking, learning, and social interaction.

Student Organizations: They struggle to reach their target audience and achieve their event goals.

Community & Culture Departments: They face challenges in fostering a sense of belonging and engagement among students.

Where and When Does the Problem Occur?
This problem occurs in educational institutions like ALU, where event information is not centralized. It is a persistent issue that affects students throughout the academic year, particularly during peak event seasons such as orientation, cultural festivals, and exam preparation periods.

What is the Impact of the Problem?
Low Event Attendance: Students miss out on events due to lack of awareness, reducing the overall impact of these events.

Reduced Engagement: The absence of a centralized platform discourages students from participating in campus activities, leading to a less vibrant campus culture.

Inefficient Promotion: Student organizations waste time and resources promoting events through ineffective channels.

Research from EdTech Magazine (2023) emphasizes that institutions with centralized event platforms see a 25% increase in student engagement, highlighting the potential impact of addressing this problem.

Why is it Important to Solve?
Solving this problem is critical because:

Enhances Student Experience: A centralized event tracker ensures students never miss out on opportunities that enrich their academic and social lives.

Boosts Event Attendance: Real-time updates and personalized notifications can increase attendance by 30-40%, as reported by Eventbrite (2023).

Strengthens Community Building: A unified platform fosters connections among students, organizations, and the institution, creating a more engaged and inclusive campus community.

According to a study published in MDPI (2021), digital event management systems significantly improve communication efficiency and user satisfaction, further underscoring the importance of this solution.
Supporting Data
According to a 2022 survey by the National Association for Campus Activities (NACA), 40% of students miss events due to poor communication [1].
 Research by EDUCAUSE highlights that 70% of students prefer mobile apps for accessing campus-related information [2].
 A 2021 study by the Pew Research Center found that 62% of young adults prefer digital communication methods over traditional ones for event updates and social engagement [3].
 Furthermore, a report from the American College Health Association (ACHA) in 2020 revealed that students are more likely to engage in campus activities if the information is presented via easy-to-access mobile platforms, with over 80% of students saying they check their phones at least once per hour for campus-related updates [4].

Conclusion
The lack of a centralized event-tracking system at ALU and similar institutions creates significant challenges for students, organizations, and the broader campus community. By addressing this problem, the Community Events Tracker will enhance student engagement, boost event attendance, and foster a stronger sense of community. This solution aligns with the growing demand for digital event management tools, as evidenced by research from EdTech Magazine, MDPI, and ERIC.gov.



3. Project Goals & Objectives
3.1 Overall Goal
